No matter how much I explain, you declare everything as manipulation and excuses.
Asking for 5 minutes means you are not important? itna argue uske peechhe? Continuing it over the next day and sendind mountain? I knew you wouldn't receive the call yesterday nor call back. Because you think I didnt respond to your message in Whatsapp. Agar reply karta to aur argument ka ant hi nahi hota. Its just too much to keep up with.
kitni baar aisa hua hai ki you were absent minded over call when I was talking. You said bhikmanga that day. Did I say ki you dont consider me important or love me? No because I know I am important to you and you love me. Hadd hoti hai matlab bachpane ki.. har chhoti cheez pe jhagadna. I know tumhein pata hai sab kuch deep inside how much I care for you.
