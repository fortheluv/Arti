No matter how much I explain, you find everything as manipulation and excuses. If I talk over phone right now, it will again be an argument.
Asking for 5 minutes means you are not important? itna argue uske peechhe?
kitne baar aisa hua hai ki you were absent minded over call when I was talking. You didnt let me share my feelings. Did I say ki you dont consider me important? Hadd hoti hai matlab bachpane ki.. har chhoti cheez pe argument.
